## Why Does Trump Want to Ban TikTok?

Trump believes TikTok poses a national security threat. He and his administration have argued that TikTok collects data from its users. They fear that this data could be accessed by the Chinese government. According to them, this could put Americans’ personal information at risk. Trump also said that TikTok could be used to spread propaganda or influence public opinion.

The concerns are based on China’s laws. Chinese companies are required to cooperate with the government if asked. This has made many U.S. officials worried about the app’s data privacy policies.

## The Executive Order

In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order. This order aimed to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. operations to an American company. The order gave a deadline for the sale. If ByteDance failed to sell, TikTok would face a ban in the United States.

Trump’s administration also targeted another Chinese app, WeChat. Both orders cited similar security concerns. The move was part of Trump’s broader efforts to counter China’s influence in technology.

## TikTok’s Response

TikTok denied the accusations. The company said it does not share data with the Chinese government. It also claimed that its data centers are located outside China. TikTok said it stores U.S. user data in the United States and Singapore.

TikTok filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. The company argued that the ban was politically motivated. They also said it violated their rights under U.S. law.

## The Sale of TikTok

To avoid a ban, ByteDance started talks to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations. Several companies showed interest. Microsoft and Oracle were among the top contenders. Eventually, Oracle and Walmart announced a deal to take a stake in TikTok. But the deal faced delays and was not finalized before Trump left office.

## Public Reaction

The potential ban sparked mixed reactions. Many TikTok users were upset. They argued that the app is a source of creativity and entertainment. Some even started online campaigns to save TikTok.

On the other hand, some people supported Trump’s decision. They believed it was necessary to protect national security. Critics of TikTok pointed out similar bans in other countries, like India.

## Legal Challenges

Trump’s attempt to ban TikTok faced legal hurdles. U.S. courts blocked the ban several times. Judges ruled that the administration had not provided enough evidence to justify the ban. They also questioned the legality of the executive order.

These legal challenges delayed any concrete action against TikTok. By the time Trump left office in January 2021, the ban was still not in effect.

## What Happened After Trump Left Office?

When Joe Biden became president, his administration reviewed Trump’s policies on TikTok. In June 2021, Biden revoked Trump’s executive order. Instead, Biden signed a new order focusing on a broader review of apps with ties to foreign governments.

Biden’s administration has continued to investigate TikTok’s data practices. They are working to address the same concerns about national security. However, they have taken a less aggressive approach compared to Trump.
